## What is Dayflow?

Dayflow is a **native macOS app** (SwiftUI) that records your screen at **1 FPS**, analyzes it **every 15 minutes** with AI, and generates a **timeline** of your activities with summaries. 
It's lightweight (25MB app size) and uses ~100MB of RAM and <1% cpu. 

> _Privacy‑minded by design_: You choose your AI provider. Use **Gemini** (bring your own API key), **local models** (Ollama / LM Studio), or **ChatGPT/Claude** (requires paid subscription). See **Data & Privacy** for details.


## Why I built Dayflow

I built Dayflow after realizing that my calendar wasn't the source of truth for how I actually spent my time. My screen was. I wanted a calm, trustworthy timeline that let me see my workday without turning into yet another dashboard I had to maintain.

Dayflow stands for ownership and privacy by default. You control the data, you choose the AI provider, and you can keep everything local if that's what makes you comfortable. It's MIT licensed and fully open source because anything that watches your screen all day should be completely transparent about what it does with that information. The app should feel like a quiet assistant: respectful of your attention, honest about what it captures, and easy to shut off.

## How it works

1) **Capture** — Records screen at 1 FPS in 15-second chunks.
2) **Analyze** — Every 15 minutes, sends recent footage to AI.
3) **Generate** — AI creates timeline cards with activity summaries.
4) **Display** — Shows your day as a visual timeline.
5) **Cleanup** — Auto-manages storage based on your configured limits (1GB–20GB or unlimited).

### AI Processing Pipeline

The efficiency of your timeline generation depends on your chosen AI provider:

## Data & Privacy

This section explains **what Dayflow stores locally**, **what leaves your machine**, and **how provider choices affect privacy**.

### Data locations (on your Mac)

All Dayflow data is stored in:
`~/Library/Application Support/Dayflow/`

- **Recordings (video chunks):** `Dayflow/recordings/` (or choose "Open Recordings..." from the Dayflow Taskbar Icon Menu)
- **Local database:** `Dayflow/chunks.sqlite`
- **Recording details:** 1 FPS capture, analyzed every 15 minutes, configurable storage limits
- **Purge / reset tip:** Quit Dayflow. Then delete the entire `Dayflow/` folder to remove recordings and analysis artifacts. Relaunch to start fresh.

### Processing modes & providers
- **Gemini (cloud, BYO key)** — Dayflow sends batch payloads to **Google's Gemini API** for analysis.
- **Local models (Ollama / LM Studio)** — Processing stays **on‑device**; Dayflow talks to a **local server** you run.
- **ChatGPT / Claude (CLI-based, paid plan required)** — Dayflow drives the **Codex CLI** (ChatGPT) or **Claude Code CLI** directly on your Mac. **Requires an active ChatGPT Plus/Pro or Claude Pro subscription.** Uses frontier reasoning models for best-in-class narrative quality.

### TL;DR: Gemini data handling (my reading of Google’s ToS)
- **Short answer: There is a way to prevent Google from training on your data.** If you **enable Cloud Billing** on **at least one** Gemini API project, Google treats **all of your Gemini API and Google AI Studio usage** under the **“Paid Services”** data‑use rules — **even when you’re using unpaid/free quota**. Under Paid Services, **Google does not use your prompts/responses to improve Google products/models**.  
  - Terms: “When you activate a Cloud Billing account, all use of Gemini API and Google AI Studio is a ‘Paid Service’ with respect to how Google Uses Your Data, even when using Services that are offered free of charge.” ([Gemini API Additional Terms](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms#paid-services-how-google-uses-your-data))  
  - Abuse monitoring: even under Paid Services, Google **logs prompts/responses for a limited period** for **policy enforcement and legal compliance**. ([Same Terms](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms#paid-services-how-google-uses-your-data))  
  - **EEA/UK/Switzerland:** the **Paid‑style data handling applies by default** to **all Services** (including AI Studio and unpaid quota) **even without billing**. ([Same Terms](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms#unpaid-services-how-google-uses-your-data))

**A couple useful nuances** (from docs + forum clarifications):
- **AI Studio is still free** to use; enabling billing changes **data handling**, not whether Studio charges you. ([Pricing page](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing))  
- **UI “Plan: Paid” check:** In **AI Studio → API keys**, you’ll typically see “Plan: Paid” once billing is enabled on any linked project (UI may evolve).  
- **Free workaround:** _“Make one project paid, keep using a free key elsewhere to get the best of both worlds.”_ The **Terms** imply **account‑level** coverage once any billing account is activated, but the **Apps** nuance above may limit this in specific UI contexts. **Treat this as an interpretation, not legal advice.**

### Local mode: privacy & trade‑offs
- **Privacy:** With **Ollama/LM Studio**, prompts and model inference run on your machine. LM Studio documents full **offline** operation once models are downloaded.
- **Quality/latency:** Local open models are improving but **can underperform** cloud models on complex summarization.
- **Power/battery:** Local inference is **GPU‑heavy** on Apple Silicon and will drain battery faster; prefer **plugged‑in** sessions for long captures.
- **Future:** We may explore **fine‑tuning** or distilling a local model for better timeline summaries.

- Ollama GPU acceleration (Metal on Apple): https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/gpu.md

### ChatGPT/Claude mode: privacy & trade‑offs
- **Privacy:** Your screen data is processed by OpenAI (ChatGPT) or Anthropic (Claude) depending on which CLI you configure. Review their respective privacy policies.
- **Quality:** Frontier reasoning models provide the highest quality narratives and summaries.
- **Subscription required:** You **must have an active paid subscription** (ChatGPT Plus/Pro at $20+/month, or Claude Pro at $20/month). The CLI tools authenticate through your existing subscription.
- **Setup:** Requires installing the [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) or [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) and staying signed in.
- **Internet:** Requires an active internet connection (no offline mode).

### Permissions (macOS)
To record your screen, Dayflow requires the **Screen & System Audio Recording** permission. Review or change later at:  
**System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen & System Audio Recording**.  
Apple’s docs: https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/control-access-screen-system-audio-recording-mchld6aa7d23/mac

---

## Configuration

- **AI Provider**
  - Choose **Gemini** (set API key), **Local** (Ollama/LM Studio), or **ChatGPT/Claude** (install CLI + paid subscription).
  - For Gemini keys: https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key
  - For ChatGPT: Install [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex), sign in with your **ChatGPT Plus/Pro** account
  - For Claude: Install [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), sign in with your **Claude Pro** account
- **Capture settings**
  - Start/stop capture from the main UI. Use **Debug** to verify batch contents.
- **Data locations**
  - See **Data & Privacy** for exact paths and a purge tip.

---

## Automation

Dayflow registers a `dayflow://` URL scheme so you can trigger common actions from Shortcuts, hotkey launchers, or scripts.

**Supported URLs**
- `dayflow://start-recording` — enable capture (no-op if already recording)
- `dayflow://stop-recording` — pause capture (no-op if already paused)

**Quick checks**
- From Terminal: `open dayflow://start-recording` or `open dayflow://stop-recording`
- In Shortcuts: add an **Open URLs** action with either link above

Deeplink-triggered state changes are logged as `reason: "deeplink"` in analytics so you can distinguish automations from manual toggles.

---

## Debug & Developer Tools

You can click the Dayflow icon in the menu bar and view the saved recordings

---

## Auto‑updates (Sparkle)

Dayflow integrates **Sparkle** via Swift Package Manager and shows the current version + a “Check for updates” action. By default, the updater **auto‑checks daily** and **auto‑downloads** updates.


## Project structure

```
Dayflow/
├─ Dayflow/                 # SwiftUI app sources (timeline UI, debug UI, capture & analysis pipeline)
├─ docs/                    # Appcast and documentation assets (screenshots, videos)
├─ scripts/                 # Release automation (DMG, notarization, appcast, Sparkle signing, one-button release)
```

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Screen capture is blank or fails**  
  Check System Settings → Privacy & Security → **Screen & System Audio Recording** and ensure **Dayflow** is enabled.
- **API errors**  
  Go into settings and verify your `GEMINI_API_KEY` and network connectivity.
